First folder: commands. Inside this folder, you'll create 4 files. The names of the files and the description of the code they will contain is mentioned below:

addTask.js: Code for Creating a new todo.
deleteTask.js: Code for Deleting a todo.
readTask.js: Code for Displaying all the todos.
updateTask.js: Code for Updating a todo.
Second folder: db. Inside this folder, add a file named connectDB.js. This file will contain the code for connecting to the MongoDB database and disconnecting when needed.

Third folder: schema. Inside it, make a file named TodoSchema.js. This file stores the Mongoose Schema and Model. Basically, a blue print for our tasks, that is how our tasks will look.

First file: .env. Create this file inside the root directory / main folder of the project. This is where you'll put your MongoDB Connection string.

Second file: Create the index.js file in the root directory itself which will serve as the entry point of our project. It's like the project's front â€“ where everything starts.
